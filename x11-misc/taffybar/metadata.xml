		A somewhat fancier desktop bar than xmobar.  This bar is based on
		gtk2hs and provides several widgets (including a few graphical ones).
		It also sports an optional snazzy system tray.
		
		Changes in v0.2.0:
		
		* Add some more flexible formatting options for the XMonadLog widget (contributed by
		cnervi).
		
		* Make the PollingLabel more robust with an exception handler for IOExceptions
		
		* Added more documentation for a few widgets
		
		Changes in v0.1.3:
		
		* Depend on gtk 0.12.1+ to be able to build under ghc 7.2
		
		* Fix the background colors in the calendar so that it follows the GTK theme instead
		of the bar-specific color settings
		
		* Fix the display of non-ASCII window titles in the XMonad log applet (assuming you use the dbusLog function)
		
		* Add a horrible hack to force the bar to not resize to be larger than the screen due to notifications or long window titles
		
		Changes in v0.1.2:
		
		* Readable widget for freedesktop notifications
		
		* Fixed a few potential deadlocks on startup
		
		* Use the GTK+ rc-file styling system for colors instead of hard coding them
