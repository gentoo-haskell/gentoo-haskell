		Combinatorrent provides a BitTorrent client, based on STM
		for concurrency. This is an early preview release which is capable of
		downloading files from various torrent trackers, but have not yet
		demonstrated to be correct in all aspects.
		It is expected that the package currently contains numerous and even
		grave bugs. Patches to fix any problem are welcome!
