		Reading two-column academic papers is awkward on the
		Kindle; you sort of have to choose between zooming way
		out, so that the text is unreadably small, or zooming in
		far enough that the text is readable, but mucking around
		with the arrow navigation keys and never quite centering
		the text on the page. This program takes two-column papers
		on standard US-letter size paper and splits them down the
		middle, producing a PDF with one page for each column. On
		the Kindle, this makes the text large enough to read while
		still allowing the convenient, built-in navigation mode.
