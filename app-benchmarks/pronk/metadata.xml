	<longdescription>
		A library and command line tool for HTTP load testing.  You can
		think of this package as similar to `httperf` or `ab`, only more
		modern, faster, more scalable, easier to deal with, programmable,
		and with customisable output.
		
		The name &quot;pronk&quot; comes from the Afrikaans verb /pronk-/, meaning
		&quot;to show off&quot; or &quot;to strut&quot;.
