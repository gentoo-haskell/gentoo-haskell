		ThreadScope is a graphical viewer for thread profile
		information generated by the Glasgow Haskell compiler
		(GHC).
		
		The Threadscope program allows us to debug the parallel
		performance of Haskell programs. Using Threadscope we can
		check to see that work is well balanced across the
		available processors and spot performance issues relating
		to garbage collection or poor load balancing.
