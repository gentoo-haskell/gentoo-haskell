		Clash is a functional hardware description language that borrows both its
		syntax and semantics from the functional programming language Haskell. The
		Clash compiler transforms these high-level descriptions to low-level
		synthesizable VHDL, Verilog, or SystemVerilog.

		Features of Clash:

		* Strongly typed, but with a very high degree of type inference, enabling both
		safe and fast prototyping using concise descriptions.

		* Interactive REPL: load your designs in an interpreter and easily test all
		your component without needing to setup a test bench.

		* Higher-order functions, with type inference, result in designs that are
		fully parametric by default.

		* Synchronous sequential circuit design based on streams of values, called
		@Signal@s, lead to natural descriptions of feedback loops.

		* Support for multiple clock domains, with type safe clock domain crossing.


		This package provides:

		* The CoreHW internal language: SystemF + Letrec + Case-decomposition

		* The normalisation process that brings CoreHW in a normal form that can be
		converted to a netlist

		* Blackbox/Primitive Handling


		Front-ends (for: parsing, typecheck, etc.) are provided by separate packages:

		* &lt;https://hackage.haskell.org/package/clash-ghc GHC/Haskell Frontend&gt;

		* &lt;https://github.com/christiaanb/Idris-dev Idris Frontend&gt;


		Prelude library: &lt;https://hackage.haskell.org/package/clash-prelude&gt;
