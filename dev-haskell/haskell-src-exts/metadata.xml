		Haskell-Source with Extensions (HSE, haskell-src-exts)
		is an extension of the standard haskell-src package,
		and handles most registered syntactic extensions to Haskell, including:
		
		* Multi-parameter type classes with functional dependencies
		
		* Indexed type families (including associated types)
		
		* Empty data declarations
		
		* GADTs
		
		* Implicit parameters
		
		* Template Haskell
		
		and a few more. All extensions implemented in GHC are supported.
		Apart from these standard extensions,
		it also handles regular patterns as per the HaRP extension
		as well as HSX-style embedded XML syntax.
