		CλaSH (pronounced 'clash') is a functional hardware description language that
		borrows both its syntax and semantics from the functional programming language
		Haskell. The CλaSH compiler transforms these high-level descriptions to
		low-level synthesizable VHDL, Verilog, or SystemVerilog.
		
		Features of CλaSH:
		
		* Strongly typed, but with a very high degree of type inference, enabling both
		safe and fast prototyping using concise descriptions.
		
		* Interactive REPL: load your designs in an interpreter and easily test all
		your component without needing to setup a test bench.
		
		* Higher-order functions, with type inference, result in designs that are
		fully parametric by default.
		
		* Synchronous sequential circuit design based on streams of values, called
		@Signal@s, lead to natural descriptions of feedback loops.
		
		* Support for multiple clock domains, with type safe clock domain crossing.
		
		
		This package provides:
		
		* Prelude library containing datatypes and functions for circuit design
		
		To use the library:
		
		* Import &quot;Clash.Prelude&quot;
		
		* Alternatively, if you want to explicitly route clock and reset ports,
		for more straightforward multi-clock designs, you can import the
		&quot;Clash.Explicit.Prelude&quot; module. Note that you should not import
		&quot;Clash.Prelude&quot; and &quot;Clash.Explicit.Prelude&quot; at the same time as they
		have overlapping definitions.
		
		A preliminary version of a tutorial can be found in &quot;Clash.Tutorial&quot;, for a
		general overview of the library you should however check out &quot;Clash.Prelude&quot;.
		Some circuit examples can be found in &quot;Clash.Examples&quot;.
