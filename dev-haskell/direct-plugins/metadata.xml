		The Plugins package unfortunately does not work on GHC 6.12, and is at any rate
		rather poorly documented.  This package uses the same general strategy but without
		quite as many options, aiming to be simple and useful rather than complete.  This
		release renames load to unsafeLoad and adds loadDynamic, which is type-safe.
