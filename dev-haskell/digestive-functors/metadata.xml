		Digestive functors is a library inspired by formlets:
		
		&lt;http://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/links/formlets/&gt;
		
		It is intended to be an improvement of the Haskell formlets library, with as
		main advantages:
		
		* better error handling, so a web page can display input errors right next
		to the corresponding fields;
		
		* the ability to easily add @\&lt;label\&gt;@ elements;
		
		* separation of the validation model and the HTML output.
		
		Tutorial:
