		This package provides the following:
		nested arrays and the primitive operators that work on them (PA functions);
		the lifted array combinators that the vectoriser introduces (PP functions);
		the user facing library functions that work on [::] style arrays (P functions).
		This implementation directly encodes sharing between array segments,
		and avoids the copying that dph-lifted-copy would otherwise do.
		Use this version for production code.
