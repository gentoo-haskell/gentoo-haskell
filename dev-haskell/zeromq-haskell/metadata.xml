		The 0MQ lightweight messaging kernel is a library which extends
		the standard socket interfaces with features traditionally provided
		by specialised messaging middleware products. 0MQ sockets provide
		an abstraction of asynchronous message queues, multiple messaging
		patterns, message filtering (subscriptions), seamless access to
		multiple transport protocols and more.
		This library provides the Haskell language binding to 0MQ and
		support 0MQ 2.x as well as 3.x (use -fzmq2 or -fzmq3 to select
		between the two).
