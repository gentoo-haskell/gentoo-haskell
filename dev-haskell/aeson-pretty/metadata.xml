		A JSON pretty-printing library compatible with aeson as well as
		a command-line tool to improve readabilty of streams of JSON data.
		
		The /library/ provides the function &quot;encodePretty&quot;. It is a drop-in
		replacement for aeson&#39;s &quot;encode&quot; function, producing JSON-ByteStrings for
		human readers.
		
		The /command-line tool/ reads JSON from stdin and writes prettified JSON
		to stdout. It also offers a complementary &quot;compact&quot;-mode, essentially the
		opposite of pretty-printing. If you specify @-flib-only@ like this
		
		&gt; cabal install -flib-only aeson-pretty
		
		the command-line tool will NOT be installed.
