		HaRP, or Haskell Regular Patterns, is a Haskell extension
		that extends the normal pattern matching facility with
		the power of regular expressions. This expressive power
		is highly useful in a wide range of areas, including text parsing
		and XML processing. Regular expression patterns in HaRP work over
		ordinary Haskell lists ([]) of arbitrary type. We have implemented
		HaRP as a pre-processor to ordinary Haskell.
		
		For details on usage, please see the website.
