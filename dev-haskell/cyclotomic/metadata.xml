		The cyclotomic numbers are a subset of the
		complex numbers that are represented exactly, enabling exact
		computations and equality comparisons.  They
		contain the Gaussian rationals (complex numbers
		of the form p + q i with p and q rational), as well
		as all complex roots of unity.  The
		cyclotomic numbers contain the square roots of
		all rational numbers.  They contain the sine and
		cosine of all rational multiples of pi.
		The cyclotomic numbers form a field, being closed under
		addition, subtraction, mutiplication, and division.
