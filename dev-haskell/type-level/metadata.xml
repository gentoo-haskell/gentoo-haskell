		This library permits performing computations on the type-level. Type-level
		functions are implemented using functional dependencies of multi
		parameter type classes.
		To date, Booleans and Numerals (Naturals and Positives) are
		supported. With regard to Numerals, there is support for common
		arithmetic operations (addition, substraction, multiplication,
		division, exponientation, logarithm, maximum, comparison, GCD)
		over natural numbers (using a decimal representation to make
		compile-time errors friendlier).
		Although making use of type-level computations might seem devious and
		obfuscated at first sight, it is indeed useful in practice to implement
		lightweight dependent types such us number-parameterized types (e.g. an array
		type parameterized by the array&#39;s size or a modular group type Zn
		parameterized by the modulus).
		Here is a tutorial on type-level numerals and how to use them to
		implement numerically-parameterized vectors: &lt;http://www.ict.kth.se/forsyde/files/tutorial/tutorial.html#FSVec&gt;
