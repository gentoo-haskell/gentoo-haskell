		This package provides type classes to allow backends to implement
		SQL DDL support for beam. This allows you to use beam syntax to
		write type-safe schema generation code.
		The package also provides features to introspect beam schemas,
		and support for automatic generation of migrations in SQL and
		Haskell formats.
		This is mostly a low-level support library. Most often, this
		library is used to write tooling to support DDL manipulation in
		your project, or to enable migrations support in beam backends.
		For a more turnkey solution for database migrations, consider
		the &lt;http://hackage.haskell.org/package/beam-migrate-cli beam-migrate&gt;
		command line tool. This provides out-of-the-box support for migrations,
		schema change management, and version control, based on the features
		provided in this library.
