		MPI is defined by the Message-Passing Interface Standard,
		as specified by the Message Passing Interface Forum. The latest release
		of the standard is known as MPI-2. These Haskell
		bindings are designed to work with any standards compliant
		implementation of MPI-2. Examples are MPICH2:
		&lt;http://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/mpich2&gt; and
		OpenMPI: &lt;http://www.open-mpi.org&gt;.
		
		In addition to reading these documents, users may also find it
		beneficial to consult the MPI-2 standard documentation provided by the
		MPI Forum: &lt;http://www.mpi-forum.org&gt;, and also the documentation for
		the MPI implementation linked to this library (that is, the MPI
		implementation that was chosen when this Haskell library was compiled).
		
		&quot;Control.Parallel.MPI.Fast&quot; contains a high-performance interface
		for working with (possibly mutable) arrays of storable Haskell data types.
		
		&quot;Control.Parallel.MPI.Simple&quot; contains a convenient (but slower)
		interface for sending arbitrary serializable Haskell data values as messages.
		
		&quot;Control.Parallel.MPI.Internal&quot; contains a direct binding to the
		C interface.
		
		&quot;Control.Parallel.MPI.Base&quot; contains essential MPI functionality
		which is independent of the message passing API. This is re-exported
		by the Fast and Simple modules, and usually does not need to be
		explcitly imported itself.
		
		Notable differences between Haskell-MPI and the standard C interface to MPI:
		
		1. Some collective message passing operations are split into send
		and receive parts to facilitate a more idiomatic Haskell style of programming.
		For example, C provides the @MPI_Gather@ function which is called
		by all processes participating in the communication, whereas
		Haskell-MPI provides &#39;gatherSend&#39; and &#39;gatherRecv&#39; which are called
		by the sending and receiving processes respectively.
		
		2. The order of arguments for some functions is changed to allow
		for the most common patterns of partial function application.
		
		3. Errors are raised as exceptions rather than return codes (assuming
		that the error handler to &#39;errorsThrowExceptions&#39;, otherwise errors
		will terminate the computation just like C interface).
		
		Below is a small but complete MPI program. Process 1 sends the message
		@\&quot;Hello World\&quot;@ to process 0, which in turn receives the message and
		prints it to standard output. All other processes, if there are any,
		do nothing.
		
		&gt;module Main where
		&gt;
		&gt;import Control.Parallel.MPI.Simple (mpiWorld, commWorld, unitTag, send, recv)
		&gt;
		&gt;main :: IO ()
		&gt;main = mpiWorld $ \size rank -&gt;
		&gt;   if size &lt; 2
		&gt;      then putStrLn &quot;At least two processes are needed&quot;
		&gt;      else case rank of
		&gt;         0 -&gt; do (msg, _status) &lt;- recv commWorld 1 unitTag
		&gt;                 putStrLn msg
		&gt;         1 -&gt; send commWorld 0 unitTag &quot;Hello World&quot;
		&gt;         _ -&gt; return ()
