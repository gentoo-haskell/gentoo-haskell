		This package contains bindings to the BSD editline library
		(&lt;http://www.thrysoee.dk/editline/&gt;).
		It provides a basic interface to the editline API for
		reading lines of input from the user.
		
		Additionally, a readline compatibility module is included
		which provides a subset of the functions from the
		readline package.
