		This version now has full text search. Serialization is now trough byteStrings
		TCache is a transactional cache with configurable persitence. It allows conventional
		STM transactions for objects that syncronize  with
		their user defined storages. Default persistence in files is provided for testing purposes
		
		This version support  the backward compatible stuff, that permits transparent
		retrievals of objects and transcactions between objects without directly using STM references
		('with*Resource(s)' calls), Now it goes in the oposite direction by providing explicit STM persistent
		references (called 'DBRefś') that leverage the nice and traditional haskell reference syntax
		for performing database transactions.
		
		'DBRef's are in essence, persistent TVars indexed in the cache, with a traditional 'readDBRef',
		'writeDBRef' Haskell interface in the STM monad.
		Additionally, because DBRefs are serializable, they can be embeded in serializable registers.
		Because they are references,they point to other serializable registers.
		This permits persistent mutable and efficient Inter-object relations.
		
		Triggers are also included in this release. They are user defined hooks that are called back on register updates. That can be used for
		easing the actualization of inter-object relations and also permit more higuer level
		and customizable accesses. The internal indexes used for the query language uses triggers.
		
		It also  implements an straighforwards non-intrusive pure-haskell type safe query language  based
		on register field relations. This module must be imported separately. See
		"Data.TCache.IndexQuery" for further information
		
		Now the file persistence is more reliable.The IO reads are safe inside STM transactions.
		
		To ease the implementation of other user-defined persistence, "Data.TCache.DefaultPersistence" needed
		to be imported  explcitly for deriving file persistence instances.
		
		The 0.9 version adds full text indexation and search, incorporated in the experimental query language
		
		It also changes the default Persistence mechanism. Now ByteStrings are used for serialization and deserialization
		. a Serializable class and a Persist structure decouple serialization to/from bytestring
		and write-read to file. Both can be redefined separately, so default persistence can be changed with `setPersist`
		to write to blobs in databases, for example. Default persistence has'nt to be in files.
