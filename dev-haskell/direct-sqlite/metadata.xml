		This package is not very different from the other SQLite3 bindings out
		there, but it fixes a few deficiencies I was finding.  As compared to
		bindings-sqlite3, it is slightly higher-level, in that it supports
		marshalling of data values to and from the database.  In particular, it
		supports strings encoded as UTF8, and BLOBs represented as ByteStrings.
		
		Release history:
		
		[Version 2.3.6] Re-apply the stat64 hack after upgrade to the bundled
		SQLite3.  Oops!
		
		[Version 2.3.5] Add support to compile bundled SQLite3 with full-text search.  Upgrade bundled SQLite3 to 3.7.17.
		
		[Version 2.3.4] Work around a linker error on some systems; add
		column-name reporting.
		
		[Version 2.3.3.1] Upgrade bundled SQLite3 to 3.7.15.2.
		
		[Version 2.3.3] Add trace support, as a feature for debugging.
		
		[Version 2.3.2] Add execPrint, execWithCallback, and interruptibly functions.
		Add bindings for sqlite3_last_insert_rowid and sqlite3_changes.  Change the
		Show instance of the Utf8 newtype to better match the IsString instance.
		
		[Version 2.3.1] Upgrade the bundled SQLite3 to 3.7.15.  Add bindings for
		sqlite3_interrupt.  Export Int rather than CInt.
		
		[Version 2.3] Mark some FFI calls &quot;unsafe&quot;, for a substantial performance
		benefit.
		
		[Version 2.2.1] Bump down text library version to match with the
		latest Haskell Platform.
		
		[Version 2.2] actually does what version 2.1 claimed to, since the author
		made a mistake with git.
		
		[Version 2.1] improves handling of invalid UTF-8 and changes error handling
		to be more complete.  It also adds a build flag to build against the system
		sqlite instead of the bundled one, optionally (disabled by default).
		
		[Version 2.0] uses Text for strings instead of String.
		
		[Version 1.1.0.1] switches to the Faction packaging system and makes no other
		changes.
		
		[Version 1.1] adds the SQLite amalgamation file (version 3.7.5) to the
		project, so that there are no external dependencies.
