		This is a wrapper to Sox the Sound Exchanger
		&lt;http://sox.sourceforge.net/&gt;
		which lets you play, write, read and convert audio signals
		in various formats, resolutions, and numbers of channels.
		
		The functions call sox commands via the shell,
		that is, the &#39;sox&#39; and &#39;play&#39; executables must be installed
		and in the path to the executables must be set.
		
		In the past this was part of the synthesizer package.
		
		There is some ancient code,
		which allows interactive playback using the shell-pipe package on GHC-6.2,
		where no runInteractiveProcess was available.
