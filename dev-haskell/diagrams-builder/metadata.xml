		@diagrams-builder@ provides backend-agnostic tools for
		dynamically turning code into rendered diagrams,
		using the @hint@ wrapper to the GHC API.  It
		supports conditional recompilation using hashing
		of diagrams source code, to avoid recompiling
		code that has not changed.  It is useful for
		creating tools which compile diagrams code
		embedded in other documents.  For example, it is
		used by the @BlogLiterately-diagrams@ package (a
		plugin for @BlogLiterately@) to compile diagrams
		embedded in Markdown-formatted blog posts.
		
		Executables specific to the cairo, SVG, and postscript
		backends are included (more executables specific
		to other backends may be included in the future).
		All take an input file and an expression to
		render, and output an image file.  If you want
		these executables you must explicitly enable the
		@-fcairo@, @-fsvg@, or @-fps@ flags.
		
		A LaTeX package, @diagrams-latex.sty@, is also
		provided in the @latex/@ directory of the source
		distribution, which renders diagrams code found
		within @diagram@ environments. Note that
		@diagrams-latex.sty@ is licensed under the GPL.
