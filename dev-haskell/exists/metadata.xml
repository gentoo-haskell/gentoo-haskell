		This package contains:
		
		* Existential datatypes for holding evidence of constraints on types of kind @*@ and @* -&gt; *@;
		
		* Type classes for existential datatypes holding evidence of constraints on types of kind @*@ and @* -&gt; *@;
		
		* Completely useless existential datatypes holding evidence of no constraint on types of kind @*@ and @* -&gt; *@;
		
		* Assorted type class instances for the above;
		
		* A type-level combinator for combining constraint constructors.
		
		(Some of these might be better off as separate packages.)
		
		&quot;Data.Exists&quot; has most of the important things.
		
		Minimum GHC: 7.4
		
		Changes in 0.2:
		
		* Removed @Comonad@-related things (they were probably useless anyways)
		
		* Added @Data.Exists.CPS@
