		__WARNING:__ While the code in this library should be fairly stable and
		production, the API is something I&#39;m still working on. API changes will
		follow the PVP, but __expect__ breaking API changes in future versions!
		
		A closable, fair, single-wakeup channel that avoids the 0 reader space leak
		that @&quot;Control.Concurrent.Chan&quot;@ from base suffers from.
		
		The @Chan@ type from @&quot;Control.Concurrent.Chan&quot;@ consists of both a read
		and write end combined into a single value. This means there is always at
		least 1 read end for a @Chan@, which keeps any values written to it alive.
		This is a problem for applications/libraries that want to have a channel
		that can have zero listeners.
		
		Suppose we have an library that produces events and we want to let users
		register to receive events. If we use a channel and write all events to it,
		we would like to drop and garbage collect any events that take place when
		there are 0 listeners. The always present read end of @Chan@ from base
		makes this impossible. We end up with a @Chan@ that forever accumulates
		more and more events that will never get removed, resulting in a memory
		leak.
		
		@&quot;BroadcastChan&quot;@ splits channels into separate read and write ends. Any
		message written to a a channel with no existing read end is immediately
		dropped so it can be garbage collected. Once a read end is created, all
		messages written to the channel will be accessible to that read end.
		
		Once all read ends for a channel have disappeared and been garbage
		collected, the channel will return to dropping messages as soon as they are
		written.
		
		__Why should I use &quot;BroadcastChan&quot; over &quot;Control.Concurrent.Chan&quot;?__
		
		* @&quot;BroadcastChan&quot;@ is closable,
		
		* @&quot;BroadcastChan&quot;@ has no 0 reader space leak,
		
		* @&quot;BroadcastChan&quot;@ has comparable or better performance.
		
		__Why should I use &quot;BroadcastChan&quot; over various (closable) STM channels?__
		
		* @&quot;BroadcastChan&quot;@ is single-wakeup,
		
		* @&quot;BroadcastChan&quot;@ is fair,
		
		* @&quot;BroadcastChan&quot;@ performs better under contention.
