	<longdescription>
		This is a set of macros to be used when writing Haskell FFI.
		They were designed to be able to fully describe C interfaces,
		so that hsc2hs can extract from them all Haskell code needed to
		mimic such interfaces. All Haskell names used are automatically
		derived from C names, structures are mapped to Haskell instances
		of Storable, and there are also macros you can use with C code
		to help write bindings to inline functions or macro functions.
		Documentation is available at package homepage:
		
		&lt;http://bitbucket.org/mauricio/bindings-dsl&gt;
		
		This package contains no Haskell code, only C header files
		designed for hsc2hs.
