		This package was developed to demonstrate the ideas behind
		the Prolog language. It contains a very small interpreter
		(@Language.Prolog.Nanoprolog@) which can be run on its
		own. It reads a file with definitions, and then prompts
		for a goal. All possibe solutions are printed, preceded by
		a tree showing which rules were applied in which order.
		
		The file @royals.pro@ contains a description of part of the Dutch royal family, whereas the file
		@tc.pro@ shows unification at work in a very small type inferencer.
