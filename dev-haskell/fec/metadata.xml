		This code, based on zfec by Zooko, based on code by Luigi
		Rizzo implements an erasure code, or forward error
		correction code. The most widely known example of an erasure
		code is the RAID-5 algorithm which makes it so that in the
		event of the loss of any one hard drive, the stored data can
		be completely recovered.  The algorithm in the zfec package
		has a similar effect, but instead of recovering from the loss
		of only a single element, it can be parameterized to choose in
		advance the number of elements whose loss it can tolerate.
