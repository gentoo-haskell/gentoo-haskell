		Many generic programs require information about the recursive positions
		of a datatype. Examples include the generic fold, generic rewriting or
		the Zipper data structure. Several generic programming systems allow to
		write such functions by viewing datatypes as fixed points of a pattern
		functor. Traditionally, this view has been limited to so-called regular
		datatypes such as lists and binary trees. In particular, families of
		mutually recursive datatypes have been excluded.
		
		With the multirec library, we provide a mechanism to talk about fixed
		points of families of datatypes that may be mutually recursive. On top
		of this representations, generic functions such as the fold or the Zipper
		can then be defined.
		
		We expect that the library will be especially interesting for compiler
		writers, because ASTs are typically families of mutually recursive datatypes,
		and with multirec it becomes easy to write generic functions on ASTs.
		
		The library is based on ideas described in the paper:
