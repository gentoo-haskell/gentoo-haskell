		This is an experimental Markdown processor in pure
		Haskell.  It aims to process Markdown efficiently and in
		the most forgiving possible way.  It is designed to deal
		with any input, including garbage, with linear
		performance.  Output is sanitized by default for
		protection against XSS attacks.
		
		Several markdown extensions are implemented, including
		fenced code blocks, significant list start numbers, and
		autolinked URLs.  See README.markdown for details.
