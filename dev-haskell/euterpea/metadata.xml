		Euterpea is a domain-specific language embedded in Haskell for
		computer music research, education, and development, providing
		both note-level and signal-level abstractions.  It is a descendant
		of Haskore and HasSound, and is intended for both educational purposes
		as well as serious computer music applications.  Euterpea is a
		wide-spectrum DSL, suitable for high-level music representation,
		algorithmic composition, and analysis; mid-level concepts such as
		MIDI; and low-level audio processing, sound synthesis, and instrument
		design.  It also includes a &quot;musical user interface,&quot; a set of
		computer-music specific GUI widgets such as keyboards, pushbuttons,
		sliders, and so on.  The performance of Euterpea is intended to be
		as good as any other computer music language, with the goal of being
		able to develop real-time applications, using both MIDI and a
		high-performance back-end for real-time audio.
