		Threepenny-GUI is a GUI framework that uses the web browser as a display.
		
		It&#39;s cheap and easy to install because everyone has a web browser installed.
		
		Internally, the library implements a small web server
		that serves a HTML/JavaScript page with the GUI elements.
		You can freely manipulate the HTML DOM and handle browser events
		from your Haskell code.
		
		Stability forecast: This is an experimental release! Send us your feedback!
		Significant API changes are likely in future versions.
		
		NOTE: This library contains examples, but they are not built by default.
		To build and install the example, use the @buildExamples@ flag like this
		
		@cabal install threepenny-gui -fbuildExamples@
