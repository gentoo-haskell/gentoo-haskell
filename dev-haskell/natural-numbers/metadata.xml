		This package provides a type of all natural numbers, that is, non-negative integers.
		
		In contrast to the @naturals@ package, it does not use an “indeterminate value” to
		represent underflows, but raises errors on underflows. We think this is more
		reasonable, as this “indeterminate value” is not really a natural.
