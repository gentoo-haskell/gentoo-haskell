	<longdescription>
		Skylighting is a syntax highlighting library with
		support for over one hundred languages.  It derives
		its tokenizers from XML syntax definitions used
		by KDE&#39;s KSyntaxHighlighting framework, so any
		syntax supported by that framework can be added.
		An optional command-line program is provided.
		Skylighting is intended to be the successor to
		highlighting-kate.
		This package provides generated syntax modules
		based on the KDE XML definitions provided by the
		@skylighting-core@ package. As a result this
		package is licensed under the GPL.
