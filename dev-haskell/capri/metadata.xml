		Capri (abbreviation of CAbal PRIvate) is a wrapper program on top of
		cabal-install to operate it in project-private mode. In this mode,
		there is no global or user package databases; only one package
		database is defined, private to the project, located under the root
		directory of a project.
		
		Capri invokes cabal-install and ghc-pkg in the way that only project&#39;s
		private package database is visible. Starting with minimally required
		set of packages, all necessary dependencies will be installed into
		that database, not affecting user or global databases.
		
		Capri is mainly intended to build executable programs. It depends
		on certain features of GHC, and is not usable with other Haskell
		compilers.
