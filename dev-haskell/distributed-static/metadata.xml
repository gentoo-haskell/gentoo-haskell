		/Towards Haskell in the Cloud/ (Epstein et al, Haskell
		Symposium 2011) introduces the concept of /static/ values:
		values that are known at compile time. In a distributed
		setting where all nodes are running the same executable,
		static values can be serialized simply by transmitting a
		code pointer to the value. This however requires special
		compiler support, which is not yet available in ghc. We
		can mimick the behaviour by keeping an explicit mapping
		(&#39;RemoteTable&#39;) from labels to values (and making sure
		that all distributed nodes are using the same
		&#39;RemoteTable&#39;). In this module we implement this mimickry
		and various extensions: type safety (including for
		polymorphic static values) and compositionality.
