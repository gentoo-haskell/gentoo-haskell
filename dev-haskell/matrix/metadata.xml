		Matrix library. Basic operations and some algorithms.
		
		To get the library update your cabal package list (if needed) with @cabal update@ and
		then use @cabal install matrix@, assuming that you already have Cabal installed.
		Usage examples are included in the API reference generated by Haddock.
		
		If you want to use GSL, BLAS and LAPACK, @hmatrix@ (&lt;http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hmatrix&gt;)
		is the way to go.
