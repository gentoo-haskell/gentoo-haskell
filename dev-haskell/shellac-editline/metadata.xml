		This package provides a Shellac backend based on the editline
		library.  editline provides a subset of the functionality
		provided by the GNU readline library.  However, it is licenced
		with a BSD-style license and is therefore suitable for some situations
		where GNU readline is not.  This backend features all the line
		editing capabilities provided by editline.
