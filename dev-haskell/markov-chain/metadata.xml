		This library can be used to generate random sequences of anything
		with a behaviour that is adapted to some training data.
		Input a marketing text or a speech and
		recompose it to another arbitrary text of this sort.
		Input a dictionary of person names and create new names.
		Input a sequence of notes and get out a new melody.
		Input a set of Haskell modules and generate ...
		nice idea but the result will certainly have neither correct syntax nor types.
		I think, it&#39;s a good thing about Haskell, that you cannot fool it so easily.
		The idea is very simple:
		The algorithm analyses your input\/training data
		with respect to how likely an @a@ or @e@ follows the letters @r@ and @e@.
		Then on recomposition it chooses subsequent letters randomly
		according to the frequencies found in the training data.
		This library is well suited for /bull-shit generators/.
