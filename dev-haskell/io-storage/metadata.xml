		This library allows an application to extend the &#39;global state&#39;
		hidden inside the IO monad with semi-arbitrary data. Data is
		required to be &#39;Typeable&#39;. The library provides an essentially
		unbounded number of key-value stores indexed by strings, with
		each key within the stores also being a string.
