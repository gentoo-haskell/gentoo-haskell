		Given a number of circles with their radii, this packags
		tries to arrange them tightly, without overlap and forming a
		large circle.
		
		Finding the optimal solution is NP hard, so only
		heuristics are feasible. This particular
		implementation is neither very good nor very fast,
		compared to the state of the art in research. Nevertheless
		it is simple to use and gives visually acceptable results.
		
		Contributions of better algorithms are welcome.
