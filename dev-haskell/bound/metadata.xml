		We represent the target language itself as an ideal monad supplied by the
		user, and provide a 'Scope' monad transformer for introducing bound variables
		in user supplied terms. Users supply a 'Monad' and 'Traversable' instance,
		and we traverse to find free variables, and use the Monad to perform
		substitution that avoids bound variables.
		
		Slides describing and motivating this approach to name binding are available
		online at:
		
		&lt;http://www.slideshare.net/ekmett/bound-making-de-bruijn-succ-less&gt;
		
		The goal of this package is to make it as easy as possible to deal with name
		binding without forcing an awkward monadic style on the user.
		
		With generalized de Bruijn term you can 'lift' whole trees instead of just
		applying 'succ' to individual variables, weakening the all variables bound
		by a scope and greatly speeding up instantiation. By giving binders more
		structure we permit easy simultaneous substitution and further speed up
		instantiation.
