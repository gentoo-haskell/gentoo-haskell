		Bindings to GLFW, a free, open source, multi-platform library for
		creating OpenGL contexts and managing input, including keyboard,
		mouse, joystick and time.
		
		GLFW-b works on Windows, Mac OS X, and many Unix-like operating
		systems.
		
		Please see README.md
		(&lt;http://github.com/bsl/GLFW-b/blob/master/README.md&gt;) for
		information about how these bindings differ from the ones in the
		GLFW package (&lt;http://hackage.haskell.org/package/GLFW&gt;).
		
		For more information about the library on which these bindings
		are based, please see &lt;http://glfw.sourceforge.net&gt;.
