		Sequence a set of Alternative actions in each possible order,
		based on \&quot;Parsing Permutation Phrases\&quot;, by Arthur Baars,
		Andres Loeh and S. Doaitse Swierstra, /Haskell Workshop 2001/.
		This is particularly useful for constructing a parser for
		permutations of elements.
		This version has a slightly different interface from the paper.
