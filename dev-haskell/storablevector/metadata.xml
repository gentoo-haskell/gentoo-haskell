		Fast, packed, strict storable arrays
		with a list interface,
		a chunky lazy list interface with variable chunk size
		and an interface for write access via the @ST@ monad.
		This is much like @bytestring@ and @binary@
		but can be used for every &#39;Foreign.Storable.Storable&#39; type.
		See also package
		&lt;http://hackage.haskell.org/package/vector&gt;
		with a similar intention.
		
		We do not provide advanced fusion optimization,
		since especially for lazy vectors
		this would either be incorrect or not applicable.
		However we provide fusion with lazy lists in the package
		&lt;http://hackage.haskell.org/package/storablevector-streamfusion&gt;.
