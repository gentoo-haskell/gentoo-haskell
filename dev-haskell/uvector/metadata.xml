		Fast unboxed arrays with a flexible interface.
		The library is built of fusible combinators, as
		described in the paper /Stream Fusion: From Lists to
		Streams to Nothing at All/.
		
		For best results, compile with your user programs
		with -O2 -fvia-C -optc-O3.
		
		This library is deprecated: please consider using the
		vector package, &lt;http://hackage.haskell.org/package/vector&gt;.
