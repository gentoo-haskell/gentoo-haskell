		TxtSushi is a collection of command line utilities for processing
		comma-separated and tab-delimited files (AKA flat files, spreadsheets).
		The most important utility (tssql) lets you perform SQL selects on CSV files.
		By focusing exclusively on processing text files with a tabular structure,
		TxtSushi simplifies common tasks like filtering, joining and transformation
		that would take more effort to accomplish with a general purpose text
		processing language.
