	<longdescription>
		This library defines an @Interpreter@ monad. It allows to load Haskell
		modules, browse them, type-check and evaluate strings with Haskell
		expressions and even coerce them into values. The library is
		thread-safe and type-safe (even the coercion of expressions to
		values).
		It is, esentially, a huge subset of the GHC API wrapped in a simpler
		API. Works with GHC 6.10.x and 6.8.x
		(this version was not tested with GHC 6.6).
