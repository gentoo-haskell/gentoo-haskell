		This package provides a wrapper around the GStreamer C library. GStreamer is a library
		for constructing graphs of media-handling components. The applications it supports
		range from simple Ogg/Vorbis playback, audio/video streaming to complex audio
		(mixing) and video (non-linear editing) processing.
