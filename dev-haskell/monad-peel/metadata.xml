		This package defines @MonadPeelIO@, a subset of @MonadIO@ into which
		generic control operations such as @catch@ can be lifted from @IO@.
		Instances are based on monad transformers in @MonadTransPeel@, which
		includes all standard monad transformers in the @transformers@
		library except @ContT@.  For convenience, it provides a wrapped
		version of Control.Exception with types generalized from @IO@ to all
		monads in @MonadPeelIO@.
