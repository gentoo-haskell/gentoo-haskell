		GDB\/MI lets programs drive GDB. It can be used, for example, by GDB
		frontends. See section 27 of the GDB manual
		
		This module encapsualtes a GDB subprocess and provides an API to send
		commands as well as receive both responses and notifications.
		
		The actual GDB behavior diverges from the GDB manual in many points, so the
		implementation of the Machine Interface highly depends on the GDB version.
		This module is tested with GDB version 7.4.
