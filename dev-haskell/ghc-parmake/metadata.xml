		&#39;ghc-parmake&#39; is a parallel wrapper for &#39;ghc --make&#39;
		intended to work as its drop-in replacement. It can
		build your Haskell program in parallel using multiple
		cores.
		&#39;ghc-parmake&#39; works by extracting a module dependency
		graph with &#39;ghc -M&#39; and then running multiple &#39;ghc -c&#39;
		processes in parallel.
		To set the number of concurrent jobs, use the &#39;-j&#39;
		option.
