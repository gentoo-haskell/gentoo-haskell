		CλaSH (pronounced 'clash') is a functional hardware description language that
		borrows both its syntax and semantics from the functional programming language
		Haskell. The CλaSH compiler transforms these high-level descriptions to
		low-level synthesizable VHDL, Verilog, or SystemVerilog.
		
		Features of CλaSH:
		
		* Strongly typed, but with a very high degree of type inference, enabling both
		safe and fast prototyping using concise descriptions.
		
		* Interactive REPL: load your designs in an interpreter and easily test all
		your component without needing to setup a test bench.
		
		* Higher-order functions, with type inference, result in designs that are
		fully parametric by default.
		
		* Synchronous sequential circuit design based on streams of values, called
		@Signal@s, lead to natural descriptions of feedback loops.
		
		* Support for multiple clock domains, with type safe clock domain crossing.
		
		
		This package provides:
		
		* CλaSH Compiler binary using GHC/Haskell as a frontend
		
		
		Prelude library: &lt;http://hackage.haskell.org/package/clash-prelude&gt;
