		Clash is a functional hardware description language that borrows both its
		syntax and semantics from the functional programming language Haskell. The
		Clash compiler transforms these high-level descriptions to low-level
		synthesizable VHDL, Verilog, or SystemVerilog.
		
		Features of Clash:
		
		* Strongly typed, but with a very high degree of type inference, enabling both
		safe and fast prototyping using concise descriptions.
		
		* Interactive REPL: load your designs in an interpreter and easily test all
		your component without needing to setup a test bench.
		
		* Higher-order functions, with type inference, result in designs that are
		fully parametric by default.
		
		* Synchronous sequential circuit design based on streams of values, called
		@Signal@s, lead to natural descriptions of feedback loops.
		
		* Support for multiple clock domains, with type safe clock domain crossing.
		
		
		This package provides:
		
		* Clash Compiler binary using GHC/Haskell as a frontend
