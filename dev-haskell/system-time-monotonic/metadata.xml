		Simple library for using the system&#39;s monotonic clock.  This library is
		geared toward programs that need to run for long periods of time.  It does
		not (necessarily) provide high-resolution timing.
		
		* On Windows, this uses @GetTickCount64@, but falls back to
		@GetTickCount@ if it is not available.  @GetTickCount64@ was
		introduced in Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008.
		Support for @QueryPerformanceCounter@ is also available, but is not
		used by default, as it is less accurate in the long run than
		@GetTickCount@.
		
		* On Linux, this uses @clock_gettime@ with @CLOCK_MONOTONIC@.
		
		Release history:
		
		[0.2] Update driver API (@SystemClock@) to prevent cumulative precision loss.
		
		[0.1] Initial release.
