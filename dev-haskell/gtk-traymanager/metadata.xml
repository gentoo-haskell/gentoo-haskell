		This package provides a wrapper around the prolific eggtraymanager code.
		Note that it is *NOT* itself a system tray widget, though it is a very
		convenient utility for implementing one.  This package adopts the style
		of gtk2hs and is designed to work well with it.
		
		Changes in 0.1.3: Remove an unnecessary include
		
		Changes in 0.1.2: depend on gtk 0.12.1 to build with ghc 7.2
