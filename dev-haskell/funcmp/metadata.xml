		Functional MetaPost is a Haskell frontend to the
		MetaPost language by John Hobby. Users write their
		graphics as Haskell programs, which then emit MetaPost
		code that can be compiled into encapsulated PostScript
		files and smoothly included into e.g. LaTeX.
		
		A collection of useful examples how to use Functional
		MetaPost can be found in the user&#39;s manual at
		&lt;http://download.savannah.nongnu.org/releases/funcmp/Manual_eng.ps&gt;. The
		document doesn&#39;t offer very much detail in terms of
		explanations, but the code samples are quite helpful.
		
		Further documentation can be found in the original
		thesis that describes the implementation. The text is
		available in German at
		&lt;http://download.savannah.nongnu.org/releases/funcmp/Thesis.ps&gt; and in
		English at
		&lt;http://download.savannah.nongnu.org/releases/funcmp/Thesis_eng.ps&gt;.
		
		Last but not least, there is a tutorial that offers many
		helpful examples available in German at
		&lt;http://download.savannah.nongnu.org/releases/funcmp/Tutorial.ps&gt; and in
		English at
		&lt;http://download.savannah.nongnu.org/releases/funcmp/Tutorial_eng.ps&gt;.
