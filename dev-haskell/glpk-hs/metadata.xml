		Friendly interface to GLPK&#39;s linear programming and mixed integer programming features.  Intended for easy extensibility,
		with a general, pure-Haskell representation of linear programs.  Also includes usefully general algebraic structures.
		To design a linear programming problem,
		use &quot;Control.Monad.LPMonad&quot; to construct the constraints and specifications.  Linear functions are essentially specified
		as @Data.Map@s from variables to their coefficients, and functions for manipulating them are available in &quot;Data.LinearProgram.LinExpr&quot;.
		Then &quot;Data.LinearProgram.GLPK&quot; provides facilities for using the GLPK solver system on your problem, with a sizable number
		of options available.
