		Network server library to handle
		over 10,000 connections. Since GHC 6.12 or
		earlier uses select(), it cannot handle
		connections over 1,024. This library uses
		the prefork technique to get over the barrier.
		Programs complied by GHC 6.10 or earlier
		with the -threaded option kill the IO thread
		when forkProcess is used. So, don&#39;t specify
		the -threaded option to use this library.
