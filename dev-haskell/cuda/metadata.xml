		The CUDA library provides a direct, general purpose C-like SPMD programming
		model for NVIDIA graphics cards (G8x series onwards). This is a collection
		of bindings to allow you to call and control, although not write, such
		functions from Haskell-land. You will need to install the CUDA driver and
		developer toolkit.
		
		&lt;http://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads&gt;
		
		The configure script will look for your CUDA installation in the standard
		places, and if the nvcc compiler is found in your PATH, relative to that.
		
		This release is for version 4.0 of the CUDA toolkit.
