		The goal of this package is to provide a library that can read time
		zone info files (aka. Olson files), and does time zone conversions
		in a /pure/ and /efficient/ way.
		
		We also provide platform-independent and/or compiled-in access to
		the standard Time Zone Dabase by the means of the companion @tzdata@
		package &lt;http://hackage.haskell.org/package/tzdata&gt;.
		
		The package is currently in an alpha phase, I&#39;m still experimenting
		with different ideas wrt. scope\/API\/implementation\/etc. All
		comments are welcome!
