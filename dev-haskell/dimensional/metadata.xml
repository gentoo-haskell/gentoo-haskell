		Dimensional is a library providing data types for performing arithmetic
		with physical quantities and units. Information about the physical
		dimensions of the quantities and units is embedded in their types and the
		validity of operations is verified by the type checker at compile time.
		The boxing and unboxing of numerical values as quantities is done by
		multiplication and division with units. The library is designed to, as
		far as is practical, enforce/encourage best practices of unit usage.
