		Cpphs is a re-implementation of the C pre-processor that is both
		more compatible with Haskell, and itself written in Haskell so
		that it can be distributed with compilers.
		
		This version of the C pre-processor is pretty-much
		feature-complete and compatible with traditional (K&amp;R)
		pre-processors.  Additional features include: a plain-text mode;
		an option to unlit literate code files; and an option to turn
		off macro-expansion.
