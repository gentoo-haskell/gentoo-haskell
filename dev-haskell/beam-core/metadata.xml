		Beam is a Haskell library for type-safe querying and manipulation of SQL databases.
		Beam is modular and supports various backends. In order to use beam, you will need to use
		@beam-core@ along with a specific backend (such as @beam-postgres@ or @beam-sqlite@) as
		well as the corresponding backend.
		For more information, see the user manual and tutorial on
		&lt;https://tathougies.github.io/beam GitHub pages&gt;.
