		The repa-image library adds support for reading and
		writing images in many formats based on the DevIL
		open source image library. Image data is represented in Haskell
		as typed, multi-dimensional repa arrays.
		
		Developer\&#39;s Image Library (DevIL) is a library to
		develop applications with very powerful image
		loading capabilities, yet with a relatively simple
		interface. DevIL can load, save, convert,
		manipulate, filter and display a wide variety of
		image formats, including:
		
		* BMP, ICO, JPG, PNG, PNM, TGA, TIF, GIF, EXIF and many more.
