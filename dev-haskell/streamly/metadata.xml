		Streamly is a framework for writing programs in a high level, declarative
		data flow programming paradigm. It provides a simple API, very close to
		standard Haskell lists.  A program is expressed as a composition of data
		processing pipes, generally known as streams.  Streams can be generated,
		merged, chained, mapped, zipped, and consumed concurrently – enabling a high
		level, declarative yet concurrent composition of programs.  Programs can be
		concurrent or non-concurrent without any significant change.  Concurrency is
		auto scaled based on consumption rate.  Programmers do not have to be aware
		of threads, locking or synchronization to write scalable concurrent programs.
		Streamly provides C like performance, orders of magnitude better compared to
		existing streaming libraries.
		
		Streamly is designed to express the full spectrum of programs with highest
		performance. Do not think that if you are writing a small and simple program
		it may not be for you. It expresses a small &quot;hello world&quot; program with the
		same efficiency, simplicity and elegance as a large scale concurrent
		application. It unifies many different aspects of special purpose libraries
		into a single yet simple framework.
		
		Streamly covers the functionality provided by Haskell lists as well as the
		functionality provided by streaming libraries like
		&lt;https://hackage.haskell.org/package/streaming streaming&gt;,
		&lt;https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pipes pipes&gt;, and
		&lt;https://hackage.haskell.org/package/conduit conduit&gt; with a simpler API and
		better performance. Streamly provides
		advanced stream composition including various ways of appending, merging,
		zipping, splitting, grouping, distributing, partitioning and unzipping of
		streams with true streaming and with concurrency. Streamly subsumes the
		functionality of list transformer libraries like @pipes@ or
		&lt;https://hackage.haskell.org/package/list-t list-t&gt; and also the logic
		programming library &lt;https://hackage.haskell.org/package/logict logict&gt;.
		The grouping, splitting and windowing combinators in streamly can be compared
		to the window operators in &lt;https://flink.apache.org/ Apache Flink&gt;.
		However, compared to Flink streamly has a pure functional, succinct and
		expressive API.
		
		The concurrency capabilities of streamly are much more advanced and powerful
		compared to the basic concurrency functionality provided by the
		&lt;https://hackage.haskell.org/package/async async&gt; package.  Streamly is a
		first class reactive programming library.  If you are familiar with
		&lt;http://reactivex.io/ Reactive Extensions&gt; you will find that it is very
		similar.  For most RxJs combinators you can find or write corresponding ones
		in streamly. Streamly can be used as an alternative to
		&lt;https://hackage.haskell.org/package/Yampa Yampa&gt; or
		&lt;https://hackage.haskell.org/package/reflex reflex&gt; as well.
		
		Streamly focuses on practical engineering with high performance. From well
		written streamly programs one can expect performance competitive to C.  High
		performance streaming eliminates the need for string and text libraries like
		&lt;https://hackage.haskell.org/package/bytestring bytestring&gt;,
		&lt;https://hackage.haskell.org/package/text text&gt; and their lazy and strict
		flavors. The confusion and cognitive overhead arising from different
		string types is eliminated. The two fundamental types in streamly are arrays
		for storage and streams for processing. Strings and text are simply streams
		or arrays of &#39;Char&#39; as they should be. Arrays in streamly have performance
		at par with the vector library.
