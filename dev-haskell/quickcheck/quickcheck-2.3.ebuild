# would work with ghc 6.8 (6.6 too?) too if we added this dep
# dev-haskell/extensible-exceptions. however, we'd prefer not to add more core
# packages, as we don't want them upgradeable (leads to trouble).
#
# this means that we can only support the architectures which has >=ghc-6.10
# and unfortunately have to drop the other arches until we get proper ghc support :(
