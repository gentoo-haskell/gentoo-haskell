		QuickCheck is a library for random testing of program properties.
		The programmer provides a specification of the program, in the form of
		properties which functions should satisfy, and QuickCheck then tests that the
		properties hold in a large number of randomly generated cases.
		Specifications are expressed in Haskell, using combinators provided by
		QuickCheck. QuickCheck provides combinators to define properties, observe the
		distribution of test data, and define test data generators.
		
		Most of QuickCheck&#39;s functionality is exported by the main &quot;Test.QuickCheck&quot;
		module. The main exception is the monadic property testing library in
		&quot;Test.QuickCheck.Monadic&quot;.
		
		If you are new to QuickCheck, you can try looking at the following resources:
		
		* The &lt;http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~rjmh/QuickCheck/manual.html official QuickCheck manual&gt;.
		It&#39;s a bit out-of-date in some details and doesn&#39;t cover newer QuickCheck features,
		but is still full of good advice.
		* &lt;https://begriffs.com/posts/2017-01-14-design-use-quickcheck.html&gt;,
		a detailed tutorial written by a user of QuickCheck.
		
		The &lt;https://hackage.haskell.org/package/quickcheck-instances quickcheck-instances&gt;
		companion package provides instances for types in Haskell Platform packages
		at the cost of additional dependencies.
