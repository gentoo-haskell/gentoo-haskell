		This library provides a binding to strptime, that allows to parse
		dates and times from strings and strict/lazy bytestrings. The library
		creates LocalTime values. It provides some extra features which
		the original strptime lacks - parsing of fractional seconds and parsing
		of ten-powers of seconds since epoch (for example milliseconds since epoch).
