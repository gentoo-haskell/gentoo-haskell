		We provide the data type @NonEmpty@ that allows to store a list-like structure
		with at least or exactly @n@ elements,
		where @n@ is fixed in the type in a kind of Peano encoding
		and is usually small.
		The datatype is intended to increase safety
		by making functions total that are partial on plain lists.
		E.g. on a non-empty list, &#39;head&#39; and &#39;tail&#39; are always defined.
		
		There are more such data types like @Optional@ and @Empty@.
		Together with @NonEmpty@ you can define a list type
		for every finite set of admissible list lengths.
		
		The datatype can be combined with Lists, Sequences and Sets
		(from the @containers@ package).
		
		The package needs only Haskell 98.
		
		Similar packages:
		
		* @semigroups@, @semigroupoids@:
		restricted to lists, minimum number of elements: 1,
		provides more type classes tailored to the use of non-empty lists.
		
		* @NonEmptyList@:
		restricted to lists, minimum number of elements: 1
		
		* @NonEmpty@:
		restricted to lists, minimum number of elements: 1,
		designed for unqualified use of identifiers
		
		* @Cardinality@:@NeverEmptyList@
		
		* &lt;http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Non-empty_list&gt;
		
		Related packages:
		
		* @Stream@:
		Lists that contain always infinitely many elements.
		
		* @fixed-list@:
		Uses the same data structure as this package
		but is intended for fixing the number of elements in a list.
		Requires multi-parameter type classes with functional dependencies.
