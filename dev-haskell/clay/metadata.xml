		Clay is a CSS preprocessor like LESS and Sass, but implemented as an embedded
		domain specific language (EDSL) in Haskell. This means that all CSS selectors
		and style rules are first class Haskell functions, which makes reuse and
		composability easy.
		
		The project is described on &lt;http://sebastiaanvisser.github.com/clay&gt;.
		
		The API documentation can be found in the top level module &quot;Clay&quot;.
