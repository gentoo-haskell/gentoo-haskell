		This library provides a Haskell implementation of
		&lt;https://github.com/Automattic/engine.io Engine.IO&gt;, a library for real-time
		client-server communication on the web. Engine.IO works with old browsers via
		XHR long-polling, and seamlessy upgrades to web sockets. This implementation
		supports the majority of the Engine.IO protocol, including text and binary
		packets and the upgrading protocol.
