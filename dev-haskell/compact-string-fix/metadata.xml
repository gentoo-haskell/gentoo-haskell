		Fast, packed, strict strings with a list interface.
		Based on &quot;Data.ByteString&quot;.
		Multiple encodings are supported.
		This is the same package as compact-string-0.3.1 except for a small fix to work with the new Exception library. Once Twan updates that package, this package will be deprecated.
