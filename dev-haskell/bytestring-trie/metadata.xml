		An efficient finite map from (byte)strings to values.
		
		The implementation is based on big-endian patricia
		trees, like &quot;Data.IntMap&quot;. We first trie on the
		elements of &quot;Data.ByteString&quot; and then trie on the
		big-endian bit representation of those elements.
		Patricia trees have efficient algorithms for union
		and other merging operations, but they&#39;re also quick
		for lookups and insertions.
		
		If you are only interested in being able to associate
		strings to values, then you may prefer the @hashmap@
		package which is faster for those only needing a
		map-like structure. This package is intended for
		those who need the extra capabilities that a trie-like
		structure can offer (e.g., structure sharing to
		reduce memory costs for highly redundant keys,
		taking the submap of all keys with a given prefix,
		contextual mapping, extracting the minimum and
		maximum keys, etc.)
