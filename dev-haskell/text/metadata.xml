		An efficient packed, immutable Unicode text type (both strict and
		lazy), with a powerful loop fusion optimization framework.
		
		The &#39;Text&#39; type represents Unicode character strings, in a time and
		space-efficient manner. This package provides text processing
		capabilities that are optimized for performance critical use, both
		in terms of large data quantities and high speed.
		
		The &#39;Text&#39; type provides character-encoding, type-safe case
		conversion via whole-string case conversion functions. It also
		provides a range of functions for converting &#39;Text&#39; values to and from
		&#39;ByteStrings&#39;, using several standard encodings.
		
		Efficient locale-sensitive support for text IO is also supported.
		
		These modules are intended to be imported qualified, to avoid name
		clashes with Prelude functions, e.g.
		
		&gt; import qualified Data.Text as T
		
		To use an extended and very rich family of functions for working
		with Unicode text (including normalization, regular expressions,
		non-standard encodings, text breaking, and locales), see
		the @text-icu@ package:
		&lt;http://hackage.haskell.org/package/text-icu&gt;
