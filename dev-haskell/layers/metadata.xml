		The @layers@ package provides the type class machinery needed to make monads
		built out of stacks of monad transformers easy to use. It introduces the
		concept of monad layers, which are a generalisation of monad transformers.
		The type class machinery provided by and the design patterns suggested by
		@layers@ allow for much more modularity than is possible with the existing
		type class machinery and design patterns. With @layers@ it is possible to
		use arbitrary monad interfaces (monad interfaces are what we call the sort
		of type classes that you see in the @mtl@ and similar packages) with
		arbtirary monad transformers (by monad transformers here, we are
		specifically to monad constructors, such as the ones defined in
		@transformers@), without ever having to explicitly define how to lift
		specific interfaces through specific transformers.
		
		@layers@ improves upon and/or replaces, in part or in whole, the following
		list of packages: @transformers@, @mtl@, @mmtl@, @transformers-base@,
		@monad-control@, @lifted-base@, @monad-peel@, @MonadCatchIO-transformers@,
		@MonadCatchIO-mtl@, @exception-transformers@, @monad-abort-fd@ and probably
		more too. There have been many attempts to either improve upoin or work
		around the deficiencies of the existing type class machinery for monad
		transformer stacks, but we believe @layers@ is the most complete of any of
		these so far.
		
		A comprehensive overview of the motivation behind @layers@ and an
		explanation of the design decisions taken is given in
		&quot;Documentation.Layers.Overview&quot;. It is /highly recommended/ that you read
		this if you are considering using this package. The core type classes of the
		package are defined in &quot;Control.Monad.Layer&quot; (this can be thought of as
		equivalent to or a replacement of &quot;Control.Monad.Trans.Class&quot; from
		@transformers@). The rest of the modules in this package export monad
		interfaces, in the &quot;Control.Monad.Interface&quot; hierarchy, including
		replacements for all of the monad interfaces of the @mtl@ package.
