		Random number generation based on modeling random
		variables in two complementary ways: first, by the
		parameters of standard mathematical distributions and,
		second, by an abstract type (&#39;RVar&#39;) which can be
		composed and manipulated monadically and sampled in
		either monadic or \&quot;pure\&quot; styles.
		
		The primary purpose of this library is to support
		defining and sampling a wide variety of high quality
		random variables.  Quality is prioritized over speed,
		but performance is an important goal too.
		
		In my testing, I have found it capable of speed
		comparable to other Haskell libraries, but still
		a fair bit slower than straight C implementations of
		the same algorithms.
		
		Changes in 0.2.4.0: Added a Lift instance that resolves
		a common overlapping-instance issue in user code.
		
		Changes in 0.2.3.1: Should now build on GHC 7.6
		
		Changes in 0.2.3.0: Added stretched exponential distribution,
		contributed by Ben Gamari.
		
		Changes in 0.2.2.0: Bug fixes in Data.Random.Distribution.Categorical.
		
		Changes in 0.2.1.1: Changed some one-field data types
		to newtypes, updated types for GHC 7.4&#39;s removal of Eq
		and Show from the context of Num, and added RVarT versions
		of random variables in Data.Random.List
