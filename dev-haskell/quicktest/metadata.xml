		QuickTest inspects Haskell source files for unit tests, and runs all tests found through GHCi with a dynamically generated test harness. This means you can simply write properties about your code, and QuickTest will test these properties en masse using QuickCheck. QuickTest is based on quickcheck-script by Koen Claessen and John Hughes.
