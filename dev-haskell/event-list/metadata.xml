		These lists manage events that are associated with times.
		Times may be given as difference between successive events
		or as absolute time values.
		Pauses before the first and after the last event are supported.
		The underlying data structures are lists of elements of alternating types,
		that is [b,a,b,...,a,b] or [a,b,a,...,a,b].
		The data structures can be used to represent
		MIDI files, OpenSoundControl message streams, music performances etc.
