		This Haskell library implements several small vectors types
		with @Double@ fields, with seperate types for each size of
		vector, and a type class for handling vectors generally.
		(Note that although this package is listed in the \&quot;graphics\&quot;
		category, the package itself has no graphics facilities. It
		just contains data structures that are useful for graphics
		work.)
		
		Changes:
		
		* Fixed a stupid bug in @union@. Until now, the function could
		sometimes return gibberish answers. Hopefully this is now fixed.
