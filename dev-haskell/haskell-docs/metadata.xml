		Given a module name and a name, it will find and display
		the documentation of that name.
		
		/EXAMPLE USAGE/
		
		&gt; $ haskell-docs Data.List.Split split
		&gt; Split a list according to the given splitting strategy. This is
		&gt;  how to &quot;run&quot; a Splitter that has been built using the other
		&gt;  combinators.
		
		/INSTALLATION/
		
		You should ensure that you have
		
		&gt; documentation: True
		
		in your .cabal/config so that the necessary
		.haddock files are generated.
		
		Haddock is very sensitive to the GHC version, and
		so too will this program be, to GHC, and to Haddock. I suggest
		installing like this:
		
		&gt; cabal install haskell-docs --constraint haddock==2.10.0
		
		But replace the 2.10.0 with the version that haddock --version gives you.
		
		I could perhaps instead have a flag for each GHC
		release back a few versions.
		
		/USING WITH GHCI/
		
		&gt; &gt; :def doc \input -&gt; return (&quot;:!haskell-docs &quot; ++ input)
		&gt; &gt; :doc System.IO getContents base
		&gt; The getContents operation returns all user input as a single string,
		&gt;  which is read lazily as it is needed
		&gt;  (same as hGetContents stdin).
		
		Add the above :def to your user .ghci to have it on start-up.
