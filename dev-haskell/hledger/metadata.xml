		hledger is a library and set of user tools for working
		with financial data (or anything that can be tracked in a
		double-entry accounting ledger.) It is a haskell port and
		friendly fork of John Wiegley&#39;s Ledger. hledger provides
		command-line, curses and web interfaces, and aims to be a
		reliable, practical tool for daily use.
