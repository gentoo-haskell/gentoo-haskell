		A general sequence representation with arbitrary
		annotations, for use as a base for implementations of
		various collection types, with examples, as described
		in section 4 of
		
		* Ralf Hinze and Ross Paterson,
		\&quot;Finger trees: a simple general-purpose data structure\&quot;,
		/Journal of Functional Programming/ 16:2 (2006) pp 197-217.
		&lt;http://www.soi.city.ac.uk/~ross/papers/FingerTree.html&gt;
		
		For a tuned sequence type, see @Data.Sequence@ in the
		@containers@ package, which is a specialization of
		this structure.
