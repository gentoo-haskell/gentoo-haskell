		A simple directory-like tree datatype, with useful IO functions and Foldable and Traversable instance
		
		Provides a simple data structure mirroring a directory tree on the
		filesystem, as well as useful functions for reading and writing
		file and directory structures in the IO monad.
		
		Importing the library and optional (useful) Foldable and Traverable libraries:
		
		&gt; import System.Directory.Tree
		&gt; import qualified Data.Foldable as F
		&gt; import qualified Data.Traversable as T
		
		Write a hand-made directory tree of textfiles (strings) to the disk.
		Simulates creating a new user Tux&#39;s home directory on a unix machine:
		
		&gt; writeDirectory$ &quot;/home&quot; :/ Dir &quot;Tux&quot; [File &quot;README&quot; &quot;Welcome!&quot;]
		
		&quot;read&quot; a directory by opening all the files at a filepath with readFile,
		returning an &#39;AnchoredDirTree String&#39; (d2). Then check for any IO failures:
		
		&gt; do (base :/ d2) &lt;- readDirectory &quot;../parent_dir/dir2/&quot;
		&gt;    let failed = anyFailed d2
		&gt;    if failed then ...
		
		Use Foldable instance function to concat a directory &#39;dir&#39; of text files into a
		single file under the same directory:
		
		&gt; do (b :/ dt) &lt;- readDirectory dir
		&gt;    let f = F.concat dt
		&gt;    return$ b :/ File &quot;ALL_TEXT&quot; f
		
		Open all the files in the current directory as lazy bytestrings, ignoring
		the base path in Anchored wrapper:
		
		&gt; import qualified Data.ByteString.Lazy as B
		&gt; do (_ :/ dTree) &lt;- readDirectoryWith B.readFile &quot;./&quot;
		
		This version also offers an experimental function `readDirectoryWithL` that does
		lazy directory IO, allowing you to treat the returned `DirTree` as if it were a
		normal lazily-generated data structure.
		
		For example, the following does only the amount of IO necessary to list the file
		names of the children of the root directory, similar to &quot;ls /&quot;:
		
		&gt; do d &lt;- readDirectoryWithL readFile &quot;/&quot;
		&gt;    mapM_ (putStrLn . name) $ contents $ free d
		
		Any ideas or suggestions for improvements are most welcome :-)
