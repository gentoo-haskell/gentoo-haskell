		This package exports bindings to Facebook&#39;s APIs (see
		&lt;http://developers.facebook.com/&gt;).  Does not have any external
		dependencies and tries to use as little resources (such as
		memory, sockets and CPU) as possible by using packages such as
		@aeson@, @attoparsec@, @bytestring@, @conduit@, @http-conduit@,
		@text@ and others.
		
		While we would like to have a complete binding to Facebook&#39;s
		API, this package is being developed on demand.  If you need
		something that has not been implemented yet, please send a pull
		request or file an issue on GitHub
		(&lt;https://github.com/meteficha/fb/issues&gt;).
