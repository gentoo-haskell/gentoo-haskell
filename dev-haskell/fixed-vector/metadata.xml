		Generic vectors with fixed length. Package is structured as follows:
		
		[@Data.Vector.Fixed@]
		Generic API. It&#39;s suitable for both ADT-based vector like @Complex@
		and array-based ones.
		
		[@Data.Vector.Fixed.Mutable@]
		Type classes for array-based implementation.
		
		[@Data.Vector.Fixed.Unboxed@]
		Unboxed vectors.
		
		[@Data.Vector.Fixed.Boxed@]
		Boxed vector which can hold elements of any type.
		
		[@Data.Vector.Fixed.Storable@]
		Unboxed vectors of @Storable@  types.
		
		[@Data.Vector.Fixed.Primitive@]
		Unboxed vectors based on pritimive package.
		
		Changes in 0.1.1
		
		* @foldM@ and @tailWith@ added. Type synonyms for numbers up to 6 are
		added. @Fun@ is reexported from @Data.Vector.Fixed@.
