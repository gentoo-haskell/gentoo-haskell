		Minimalist library to read and write MIDI files, with
		dependencies only on ByteString and Data.Binary.
		
		Changelog:
		
		v0.5.0 to v0.6.0:
		
		* Extended the parser and changed the syntax tree to interpret
		MIDI Running Status.
		
		* Added a module @ZMidi.Core.Canonical@ to translate MidiFiles
		to a canonical form where any shorthand NoteOff introduced by
		Running Status is expanded to regular NoteOn and NoteOff
		events (with Running Status set, MidiFiles can signal NoteOff
		events as another NoteOn with 0 channel velocity).
		
		* Added a hack to the pretty printer to stop printing ASCII
		chars greater than 164 causing an error when printing to
		stdout.
		
		v0.4.0 to v0.5.0:
		
		* Changed order of @MidiVoiceEvent@ constructors so the Ord
		instance follows the order of the /tag/ in the MIDI binary
		representation.
		
		* Changed @MidiSysCommonEvent@ to have different constructors
		for unidentified F4 anf F5 events.
		
		* Changed @MidiSysRealTimeEvent@ to have different constructors
		for unidentified F9 and FD events.
		
		* Added more Haddock docs.
		
		* Various internal code changes.
		
		v0.3.0 to v0.4.0:
		
		* Added new constructors to @MidiMetaEvent@ for MidiPort and
		MetaOther. MetaOther recognizes otherwise unrecognized events
		improving the robustness of the parser. Similarly a new
		/other/ constructor has been added to @MidiScaleType@ to
		avoid parse errors.
		
		v0.2.1 to v0.3.0:
		
		* Revised naming of the MIDI data types. All data types now have
		the prefix Midi (previously only MidiFile followed this scheme).
		The rationale for this is client software, that might want a
		higher-level representation, is then free to use the more
		generic names Track, Message, etc.
		
		* @DeltaTime@ made a newtype wrapper rather than a type synonym.
		
		* Renamed the pretty print functions @track@ to @printMidiTrack@
		and @header@ to @printMidiHeader@.
		
		* Moved internal dataypes (SplitByte, Varlen) into a private
		module.
		
		v0.2.0 to v0.2.1:
		
		* Added Show class constraints to various type signatures to
		accommodate changes to Num superclass hierarchy in GHC 7.4.
		Thanks to Remy Moueza for the patches.
		
		v0.1.0 to v0.2.0:
		
		* Added a top-level /shim/ module to import all the exposed
		modules. Added a version number module
