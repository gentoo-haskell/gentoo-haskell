		This package provides types which mirror the structures
		used in the XCB code generation XML files.
		
		See project http://xcb.freedesktop.org/ for more information about the XCB
		project.
		
		The XML files describe the data-types, events and requests used by the
		X Protocol, and are used to auto-generate large parts of the XCB project.
		
		This package parses these XML files into Haskell data structures.
		
		If you want to do something with these XML descriptions but don&#39;t want
		to learn XSLT, this package should help.
		
		This version of xcb-types is intended to fully parse the X Protocol
		description version 1.4.
