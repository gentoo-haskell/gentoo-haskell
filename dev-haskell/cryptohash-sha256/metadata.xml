		A practical incremental and one-pass, pure API to
		the [SHA-256 cryptographic hash algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2) according
		to [FIPS 180-4](http://dx.doi.org/10.6028/NIST.FIPS.180-4)
		with performance close to the fastest implementations available in other languages.
		
		The core SHA-256 algorithm is implemented in C and is thus expected
		to be as fast as the standard [sha256sum(1) tool](https://linux.die.net/man/1/sha256sum);
		for instance, on an /Intel Core i7-3770/ at 3.40GHz this implementation can
		compute a SHA-256 hash over 230 MiB of data in under one second.
		(If, instead, you require a pure Haskell implementation and performance is secondary, please refer to the [SHA package](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/SHA).)
		
		
		Additionally, this package provides support for
		
		- HMAC-SHA-256: SHA-256-based [Hashed Message Authentication Codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC) (HMAC)
		- HKDF-SHA-256: [HMAC-SHA-256-based Key Derivation Function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HKDF) (HKDF)
		
		conforming to [RFC6234](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6234), [RFC4231](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4231), [RFC5869](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5869), et al..
		
		=== Relationship to the @cryptohash@ package and its API
		
		This package has been originally a fork of @cryptohash-0.11.7@ because the @cryptohash@
		package had been deprecated and so this package continues to satisfy the need for a
		lightweight package providing the SHA-256 hash algorithm without any dependencies on packages
		other than @base@ and @bytestring@. The API exposed by @cryptohash-sha256-0.11.*@&#39;s
		&quot;Crypto.Hash.SHA256&quot; module is guaranteed to remain a compatible superset of the API provided
		by the @cryptohash-0.11.7@&#39;s module of the same name.
		
		Consequently, this package is designed to be used as a drop-in replacement for @cryptohash-0.11.7@&#39;s
		&quot;Crypto.Hash.SHA256&quot; module, though with
		a [clearly smaller footprint by almost 3 orders of magnitude](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/5lxv75/psa_please_use_unique_module_names_when_uploading/dbzegx3/).
