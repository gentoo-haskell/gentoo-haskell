		Parse Graphviz xdot files and interactively view them using
		GTK and Cairo.
		
		Currently not all xdot features are supported. Nodes and
		edges can be highlighted by hovering them and clicked.
		
		For an example of using this library try the accompanying
		@Demo.hs@ with the dot-files in @dot-examples/@.
		
		This library was originally written as part of ghc-vis, but
		is now a seperate project, in case anyone else may have a
		use for it.
