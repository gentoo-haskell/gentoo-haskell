		This package includes backported versions of types that were added
		to transformers in transformers 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 for users who need strict
		transformers 0.2 or 0.3 compatibility to run on old versions of the
		platform, but also need those types.
		
		Those users should be able to just depend on @transformers &gt;= 0.2@
		and @transformers-compat &gt;= 0.3@.
		
		Note: missing methods are not supplied, but this at least permits the types to be used.
