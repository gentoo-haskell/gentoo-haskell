		A @Scientific@ number is an arbitrary-precision floating-point number
		represented using scientific notation.
		
		A scientific number with &#39;coefficient&#39; @c@ and
		&#39;base10Exponent&#39; @e@ corresponds to the
		&#39;Fractional&#39; number: @&#39;fromInteger&#39; c * 10 &#39;^^&#39; e@
		
		Its primary use-case is to serve as the target of
		parsing floating point numbers. Since the textual
		representation of floating point numbers use
		scientific notation they can be efficiently
		parsed to a @Scientific@ number.
