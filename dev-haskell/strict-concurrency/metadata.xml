	<longdescription>
		This package provides head normal form strict versions of some
		standard Haskell concurrency abstractions (MVars,Chans), which
		provide control over where evaluation takes place not offered by
		the default lazy types. This may be useful for deciding when and
		where evaluation occurs, leading to improved time or space use,
		depending on the circumstances.
