		This library offers an alternative parallel programming
		API to that provided by the @parallel@ package.
		The &#39;Par&#39; monad allows the simple description of
		parallel computations, and can be used to add
		parallelism to pure Haskell code.  The basic API
		is straightforward: the monad supports forking
		and simple communication in terms of &#39;IVar&#39;s.
		The library comes with an efficient work-stealing
		implementation, but the internals are also
		exposed so that you can build your own scheduler
		if necessary.
		Examples of use can be found in the examples/ directory
		of the source package.
