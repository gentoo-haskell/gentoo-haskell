		Shake is a Haskell library for writing build systems - designed as a
		replacement for make. To use Shake the user writes a Haskell program
		that imports the Shake library, defines some build rules, and calls
		shake. Thanks to do notation and infix operators, a simple Shake program
		is not too dissimilar from a simple Makefile. However, as build systems
		get more complex, Shake is able to take advantage of the excellent
		abstraction facilities offered by Haskell and easily support much larger
		projects.
		
		The Shake library provides all the standard features available in other
		build systems, including automatic parallelism and minimal rebuilds.
		Shake provides highly accurate dependency tracking, including seamless
		support for generated files, and dependencies on system information
		(i.e. compiler version). Shake can produce profile reports, indicating
		which files and take longest to build, and providing an analysis of the
		parallelism.
		
		The theory behind an old version of Shake is described in a video at
		&lt;http://vimeo.com/15465133&gt;, and an example is given at the top of
		&quot;Development.Shake&quot;. Further examples are included in the Cabal tarball,
		under the @Examples@ directory.
