		This library lets you create a one-shot timer, poll it using STM,
		and update it to ring at a different time than initially specified.
		
		It uses GHC event manager timeouts when available
		(GHC 7.2+, @-threaded@, non-Windows OS), yielding performance similar
		to @threadDelay@ and @registerDelay@.  Otherwise, it falls back to
		forked threads and @threadDelay@.
		
		[0.1.1]
		Add tryWaitDelayIO, improve performance for certain cases of @newDelay@
		and @updateDelay@, and improve example.
