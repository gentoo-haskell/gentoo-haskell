		This package contains bindings to the SDL 2 library, in both high- and
		low-level forms:
		
		The &#39;SDL&#39; namespace contains high-level bindings, where enumerations are split
		into sum types, and we perform automatic error-checking.
		
		The &#39;SDL.Raw&#39; namespace contains an almost 1-1 translation of the C API into
		Haskell FFI calls. As such, this does not contain sum types nor error
		checking. Thus this namespace is suitable for building your own abstraction
		over SDL, but is not recommended for day-to-day programming.
		
		Read &quot;SDL&quot; for a getting started guide.
