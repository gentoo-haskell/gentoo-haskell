		A Haskell binding to the liblzf by Marc Lehmann. LZF is a fast
		compression algorithm sacrifising compression quality for an extra
		bit of speed. The tiny library is contained in the source and
		statically linked in the Haskell library resulting in no external
		dependencies.  Exposed-modules: Codec.Compression.LZF
