		An implementation of multi-prompt delimited continuations based
		on the paper, /A Monadic Framework for Delimited Continuations/,
		by R. Kent Dybvig, Simon Peyton Jones and Amr Sabry
		(&lt;http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~sabry/papers/monadicDC.pdf&gt;).
		It also includes a corresponding implementation of dynamically
		scoped variables, as implemented in the paper,
		/Delimited Dynamic Binding/, by Oleg Kiselyov, Chung-chieh Shan
		and Amr Sabry
		(&lt;http://okmij.org/ftp/papers/DDBinding.pdf&gt;),
		adapted from the original haskell code,
		(&lt;http://okmij.org/ftp/packages/DBplusDC.tar.gz&gt;).
