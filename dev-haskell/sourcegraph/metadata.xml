		Statically analyse Haskell source code using graph-theoretic
		techniques.  Sample reports can be found at:
		&lt;http://code.haskell.org/~ivanm/Sample_SourceGraph/SampleReports.html&gt;
		
		To use SourceGraph, call it as either:
		
		&gt; SourceGraph path/to/Foo.cabal
		
		Or, if your project doesn&#39;t use Cabal, then there is limited support
		for using an overall module from your program\/library:
		
		&gt; SourceGraph path/to/Foo.hs
		
		Note that the Cabal method is preferred, as it is better able to
		determine the project name and exported modules (when passing a
		Haskell file to SourceGraph, it uses that module&#39;s name as the overall
		name of project and assumes that it is the only exported module; as
		such, it works better for programs than libraries).
		
		Whichever way you run SourceGraph, it then creates a @SourceGraph@
		subdirectory in the same directory as the file that was passed to it,
		and within that subdirectory creates the analysis report in
		@Foo.html@.
		
		SourceGraph is still experimental in terms of its ability to parse and
		properly understand Haskell source code and in the types of analyses
		it performs.
