		cabal-dev is a tool for managing development builds of
		Haskell projects. It supports maintaining sandboxed
		cabal-install repositories, and sandboxed ghc package
		databases.
		
		By default, it uses a cabal-dev directory under
		the current working directory as the sandbox.
		
		For most packages, just use @cabal-dev@ instead of
		@cabal@, and you will get a sandboxed build that
		will not install anything (even automatically installed
		dependencies) into the user or global ghc package
		databases.
		
		If your build depends on patched or unreleased libraries,
		you can add them to your sandboxed build environment so
		they can be installed by @cabal-dev@ or @cabal@. Just run:
		
		&gt; cabal-dev add-source /path/to/source/code
		
		@cabal-dev add-source@ also supports importing tarballs
		into a local cabal repository.
		
		Alternatively, install unreleased dependencies into the
		target cabal-dev sandbox instead of using @add-source@:
		
		&gt; cd /path/to/dependency
		&gt; cabal-dev install --sandobox=/path/to/sandbox
		
		Then build your library/application with the specified
		sandbox.
		
		
		Additional documentation can be found in the README.md on
		github:
