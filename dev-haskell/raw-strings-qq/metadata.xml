		A quasiquoter for raw string literals - that is, string literals that don&#39;t
		recognise the standard escape sequences (such as @\&#39;\\n\&#39;@). Basically, they
		make your code more readable by freeing you from the responsibility to
		escape backslashes. They are useful when working with regular expressions,
		DOS/Windows paths and markup languages (such as XML).
		
		See @examples/RawRegex.hs@ for a usage example.
