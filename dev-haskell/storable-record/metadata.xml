		With this package
		you can build a Storable instance of a record type
		from Storable instances of its elements in an elegant way.
		It does not do any magic,
		just a bit arithmetic to compute the right offsets,
		that would be otherwise done manually
		or by a preprocessor like C2HS.
		I cannot promise that the generated memory layout
		is compatible with that of a corresponding C struct.
		However, the module generates the smallest layout
		that is possible with respect to the alignment of the record elements.
		If you encounter, that a record does not have a compatible layout,
		we should fix that.
		But also without C compatibility this package is useful
		e.g. in connection with StorableVector.
		
		We provide Storable instance support for several cases:
		
		* If you wrap a type in a @newtype@,
		then you can lift its &#39;Storable&#39; instance to that @newtype@
		with the module &quot;Foreign.Storable.Newtype&quot;.
		This way you do not need the @GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving@ feature of GHC.
		
		* If you have a type that is an instance of &#39;Traversable&#39;,
		you can use that feature for implementation of &#39;Storable&#39; methods.
		The module &quot;Foreign.Storable.Traversable&quot;
		allows manipulation of the portion of your type,
		that is accessible by &#39;Traversable&#39; methods.
		For instance with the type
		@data T a = Cons Int [a]@
		and an according &#39;Traversable&#39; implementation,
		you can load and store the elements of the contained list.
		This may be part of a &#39;Storable&#39; implementation of the whole type.
		
		* If you have a record containing elements of various types,
		then you need module &quot;Foreign.Storable.Record&quot;.
		
		Note however that the Storable instances
		defined with this package are quite slow in (up to) GHC-6.12.1.
		I&#39;m afraid this is due to incomplete inlining,
		but we have still to investigate the problem.
		
		For examples see packages @storable-tuple@ and @sample-frame@.
