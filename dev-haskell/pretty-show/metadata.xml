		We provide a library and an executable for working with derived &#39;Show&#39;
		instances. By using the library, we can parse derived &#39;Show&#39; instances into a
		generic data structure. The @ppsh@ tool uses the library to produce
		human-readable versions of &#39;Show&#39; instances, which can be quite handy for
		debugging Haskell programs.
