		The Mersenne twister is a pseudorandom number generator developed by
		Makoto Matsumoto and Takuji Nishimura that is based on a matrix linear
		recurrence over a finite binary field. It provides for fast generation
		of very high quality pseudorandom numbers
		
		This library uses SFMT, the SIMD-oriented Fast Mersenne Twister, a
		variant of Mersenne Twister that is much faster than the original.
		It is designed to be fast when it runs on 128-bit SIMD. It can be
		compiled with either SSE2 and PowerPC AltiVec support, to take
		advantage of these instructions.
		
		&gt; cabal install -fuse_sse2
		
		On an x86 system, for performance win.
		
		By default the period of the function is 2^19937-1, however, you can
		compile in other defaults. Note that this algorithm on its own
		is not cryptographically secure.
		
		For more information about the algorithm and implementation, see
		the SFMT homepage,
