		Template Haskell code to implement default implementations
		for type-class functions based on which functions are
		already implemented.  Currently extremely crude but
		still fairly effective.
		
		When defining a type class with many functions, each
		of which can be implemented based on arbitrary subsets
		of the others, the standard default-implementation
		concept breaks down quite badly.  This library provides
		a system by which more complex rules can be described
		for choosing default implementations based on which
		ones the user supplies.  These implementations can
		additionally be given \&quot;suitability scores\&quot;, so that
		when multiple possible choices could be made, the
		library can choose the \&quot;best\&quot; one.
		
		Changes in 0.0.1.0: Updated for Template Haskell changes
		in GHC 7.6
		
		Changes in v0.0.0.3:  Added a hack to fix under GHC 7.2.
		
		Changes in v0.0.0.2:  Nothing at all except setting
		&#39;buildable: False&#39; under GHC 7.2.1.
