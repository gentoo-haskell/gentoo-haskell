		Pathlib provides an API for parsing and manipulating *tree* paths,
		represented as bytestrings. The path types come with witnesses
		(similar to the pathtype package) for improved type safety,
		although they are optional and disabled by the default interface
		(&quot;Data.Path&quot;) since they can be somewhat inconvenient. The safe
		interface is exported by &quot;Data.Path.Witnessed&quot;.
		
		A number of path combinators is provided (&lt;/&gt;, &lt;.&gt;, +/+), as well
		as a few selectors (especially well suited for use as view
		patterns or pattern guards). All paths are kept normalised and
		this invariant is maintained throughout the API, providing both
		nicer path strings and easier equality checking.
		
		The API is limited to trees, which means that POSIX systems that
		allow arbitrary graphs in the filesystem, through symlinks, are
		not supported 100 % correctly: the @..@ components in paths are,
		in path parsing and manipulation, treated as parent directory of
		the *path* and the actual @..@ hardlinks in the filesystem are not
		consulted. This is consistent with the behaviour of @cd ..@ in
		shells, but inconsistent with how paths are resolved by the
		operating system.
