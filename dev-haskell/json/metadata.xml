		JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange
		format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for
		machines to parse and generate.  It is based on a subset of the
		JavaScript Programming Language, Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition -
		December 1999.
		
		This library provides a parser and pretty printer for converting
		between Haskell values and JSON.
