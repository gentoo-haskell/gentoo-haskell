		This is a generic programming library in the spirit of
		\&quot;Scrap your boilerplate with class\&quot;, but with several
		improvements most notably, it&#39;s based on the @gtraverse@
		function instead of @gfoldl@.
		@gtraverse@ is equivalent in power to @gfoldl@, but lets
		you more easily write non-standard views of the data type.
