		Takusen is a DBMS access library. Like HSQL and HDBC, we support
		arbitrary SQL statements (currently strings, extensible to anything
		that can be converted to a string).
		
		Takusen&#39;s unique selling point is safety and efficiency.
		We statically ensure all acquired database resources - such
		as cursors, connections, and statement handles - are released, exactly
		once, at predictable times. Takusen can avoid loading the whole result
		set in memory, and so can handle queries returning millions of rows in
		constant space. Takusen also supports automatic marshalling and
		unmarshalling of results and query parameters. These benefits come
		from the design of query result processing around a left-fold
		enumerator.
		
		Currently we fully support ODBC, Oracle, Sqlite, and PostgreSQL.
