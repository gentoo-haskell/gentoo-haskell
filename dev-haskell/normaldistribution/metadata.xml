		This purpose of this library is to have a simple API and no
		dependencies beyond Haskell 98 in order to let you produce
		normally distributed random values with a minimum of fuss. This
		library does /not/ attempt to be blazingly fast nor to pass
		stringent tests of randomness. It attempts to be very easy to
		install and use while being \&quot;good enough\&quot; for many applications
		(simulations, games, etc.). The API builds upon and is largely
		analogous to that of the Haskell 98 @Random@ module (more
		recently @System.Random@).
		
		Pure:
		
		&gt; (sample,g) = normal  myRandomGen  -- using a Random.RandomGen
		&gt; samples    = normals myRandomGen  -- infinite list
		&gt; samples2   = mkNormals 10831452   -- infinite list using a seed
		
		In the IO monad:
		
		&gt; sample    &lt;- normalIO
		&gt; samples   &lt;- normalsIO  -- infinite list
		
		With custom mean and standard deviation:
		
		&gt; (sample,g) = normal&#39;    (mean,sigma) myRandomGen
		&gt; samples    = normals&#39;   (mean,sigma) myRandomGen
		&gt; samples2   = mkNormals&#39; (mean,sigma) 10831452
		
		&gt; sample    &lt;- normalIO&#39;  (mean,sigma)
		&gt; samples   &lt;- normalsIO&#39; (mean,sigma)
		
		Internally the library uses the Box-Muller method to generate
		normally distributed values from uniformly distributed random values.
		If more than one sample is needed taking samples off an infinite
		list (created by e.g. &#39;normals&#39;) will be roughly twice as efficient
		as repeatedly generating individual samples with e.g. &#39;normal&#39;.
