		A comprehensive and efficient implementation of AVL trees. The raw AVL
		API has been designed with efficiency and generality in mind, not elagance or
		safety. It contains all the stuff you really don&#39;t want to write yourself if you
		can avoid it. This library may be useful for rolling your own Sets, Maps, Sequences,
		Queues (for example).
