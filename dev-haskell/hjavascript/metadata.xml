		HJavaScript defines an abstract syntax and pretty printer for
		a subset of JavaScript. as Language.HJavaScript. However, a significant
		difference from JavaScript is that HJavaScript is typed, even on the
		abstract syntax level using GADTs. The subset of JavaScript that is
		supported is those parts that lend themself to typing
		(i.e. no prototyping of classes).
