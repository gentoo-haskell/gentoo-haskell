		Bindings to the LLVM compiler toolkit.
		
		We try to stay up to date with LLVM releases.  The current version
		of this package is compatible with LLVM 2.9 and 2.8.  Please
		understand that the package may or may not work against older LLVM
		releases; we don&#39;t have the time or resources to test across
		multiple releases.
		
		* New in 0.9.1.1: Builds against LLVM 2.9.
		
		* New in 0.9.1.0: Util.Memory for memory related intrinsics.
		
		* New in 0.9.0.0: Adapted to LLVM 2.8 (removed support for Union types).
