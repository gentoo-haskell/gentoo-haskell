		This is a strict version of the Get monad from the binary
		package. It&#39;s pretty much just a copy and paste job from the
		original source code. The binary team are currently unsure
		about their future plans w.r.t. strictness, so this is just a
		stop gap measure. See
		&lt;http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/DealingWithBinaryData&gt; for
		documentation.
