		This package provides unary type level representations of the
		(positive and negative) integers and basic operations (addition,
		subtraction, multiplication, division) on these.
		Due to the unary implementation the practical size of the
		NumTypes is severely limited making them unsuitable for
		large-cardinality applications. If you will be working with
		integers beyond (-20, 20) this package probably isn&#39;t for you.
		It is, however, eminently suitable for applications such as
		representing physical dimensions (see the &#39;Dimensional&#39; library).
		Requires GHC 6.6.1 or later.
