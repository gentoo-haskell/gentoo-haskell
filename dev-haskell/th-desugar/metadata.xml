		This package provides the Language.Haskell.TH.Desugar module, which desugars
		Template Haskell&#39;s rich encoding of Haskell syntax into a simpler encoding.
		This desugaring discards surface syntax information (such as the use of infix
		operators) but retains the original meaning of the TH code. The intended use
		of this package is as a preprocessor for more advanced code manipulation
		tools. Note that the input to any of the ds... functions should be produced
		from a TH quote, using the syntax [| ... |]. If the input to these functions
		is a hand-coded TH syntax tree, the results may be unpredictable. In
		particular, it is likely that promoted datatypes will not work as expected.
