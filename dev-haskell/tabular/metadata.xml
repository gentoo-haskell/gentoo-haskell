		Tabular provides a Haskell representation of two-dimensional
		data tables, the kind that you might find in a spreadsheet or
		or a research report.  It also comes with some default
		rendering functions for turning those tables into ASCII art,
		simple text with an arbitrary delimiter, CSV, HTML or LaTeX.
		
		Below is an example of the kind of output this library produces.
		The tabular package can group rows and columns, each group
		having one of three separators (no line, single line, double line)
		between its members.
		
		&gt;     || memtest 1 | memtest 2 ||  time test  | time test 2
		&gt; ====++===========+===========++=============+============
		&gt; A 1 ||       hog |  terrible ||        slow |      slower
		&gt; A 2 ||       pig |   not bad ||        fast |     slowest
		&gt; ----++-----------+-----------++-------------+------------
		&gt; B 1 ||      good |     awful || intolerable |    bearable
		&gt; B 2 ||    better | no chance ||    crawling |     amazing
		&gt; B 3 ||       meh |   well... ||  worst ever |          ok
