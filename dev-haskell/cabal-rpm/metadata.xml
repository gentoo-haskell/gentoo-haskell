		This package provides a RPM packaging tool for Haskell Cabal-based packages.
		
		cabal-rpm has commands to generate a RPM spec file and srpm for a package.
		It can rpmbuild packages, yum/dnf install their dependencies, prep packages,
		and install them. There are commands to list package dependencies and
		missing dependencies. The diff command compares the current spec file with
		a freshly generated one, the update command updates the spec file to latest
		version from Stackage or Hackage, and the refresh command updates the spec
		file to the current cabal-rpm packaging. It also handles Hackage revisions of
		packages. Standalone packages can also be made, built with cabal-install.
