		This module provides the function &#39;rdtsc&#39; for accessing
		the &#39;rdtsc&#39; machine register on modern IA-32 processors.  This is
		a 64-bit counter which counts the number of processor cycles since
		the machine has been powered up.  Using this instruction, you can
		make very precise time measurements which are independent of the
		actual CPU frequency.  But note that you can get strange results
		sometimes on a superscalar processor.
		
		Also note that the Haskell foreign function interface imposes some
		additional overheads.  On my machine, it takes about 950 cycles to
		call this function twice and to compute the difference, whereas in
		C the overhead is only about 88 cycles.
