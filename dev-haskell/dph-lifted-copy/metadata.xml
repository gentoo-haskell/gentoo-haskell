		Using this package can cause the vectorised program to have worse
		asymptotic complexity than the original.
		Use dph-lifted-vseg instead.
		This package provides the following:
		nested arrays and the primitive operators that work on them (PA functions);
		the lifted array combinators that the vectoriser introduces (PP functions);
		the user facing library functions that work on [::] style arrays (P functions).
		Deprecated implementation that performs deep copying replicate.
