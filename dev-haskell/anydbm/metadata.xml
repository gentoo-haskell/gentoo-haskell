		This module provides a generic infrastructure for supporting storage
		of hash-like items with String-to-String mappings.  It can be used
		for in-memory or on-disk storage.
		
		Two simple backend drivers are included with this package: one
		that is RAM-only, and one that is persistent and disk-backed.
		The hdbc-anydbm package provides another driver, which lets you use
		simple tables in any SQL database to provide a DBM-like interface.
		MissingPy also provides a Python driver which lets you use any
		Python anydbm driver under Haskell AnyDBM.
