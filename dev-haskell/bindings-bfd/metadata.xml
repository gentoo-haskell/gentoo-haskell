		These are bindings for `libbfd&#39;, a library of the GNU
		`binutils&#39; package.  The bindings let a Haskell program
		query the structure of any executable, object, or
		library file format supported by the GNU Project (many).
		It also has support for disassembly of code in these
		files where available.
