		This library contains three modules,
		
		* Network.Services.TSN.Logging
		
		* Network.Services.TSN.Report
		
		* Network.Services.TSN.Terminal
		
		They work together to provide \&quot;reporting\&quot; for the htsn and htsn-import
		executables which both display and log things in the same way.
		
		The Network.Services.TSN.Logging module allows the application to
		log to syslog, a file, or both. Four convenience functions are
		provided to log messages at each priority: error, debug, info, and
		warn.
		
		The Network.Services.TSN.Terminal provides similar functions that
		instead display messages on the console (terminal). The output is
		color-coded according to the severity of the message.
		
		The Network.Services.TSN.Report modules contains convenience
		functions that both log and display informational message. This is
		what an (optionally interactive) application will usually want to
		do.
