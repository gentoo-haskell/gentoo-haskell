		hothasktags generates ctags files for Haskell, with knowledge of import lists
		and qualified imports.  It provides a smart go-to-definition for vim, that almost
		always gets it right in the presence of multiple names from different modules.
		You will want to configure vim to allow dots in keywords, because hothasktags
		generates tags for qualified names.  You can do this with:
		set iskeyword=a-z,A-Z,_,.,39
		(The 39 is for the prime character)
		Usage is easy, just give hothasktags the names of all the haskell sources you
		want to index and redirect into a tags file.  For example:
		find . | egrep &#39;\.hs$&#39; | xargs hothasktags &gt; tags
		will index all the hs files under the current directory.
