		The Edge has always been a rough patch of interstellar
		space filled with innumerable bad guys of every nefarious
		sort, and dangerous debris flying in every direction at
		high speeds. But now it has grown out of control and is
		threatening to overflow into colonial space. Central
		command has decided to send in their newest super weapon,
		the Mark II Lance fighter, piloted by their top ace pilot.
		Good luck commander!
