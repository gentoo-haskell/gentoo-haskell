		git-annex allows managing files with git, without checking the file
		contents into git. While that may seem paradoxical, it is useful when
		dealing with files larger than git can currently easily handle, whether due
		to limitations in memory, checksumming time, or disk space.
		
		Even without file content tracking, being able to manage files with git,
		move files around and delete files with versioned directory trees, and use
		branches and distributed clones, are all very handy reasons to use git. And
		annexed files can co-exist in the same git repository with regularly
		versioned files, which is convenient for maintaining documents, Makefiles,
		etc that are associated with annexed files but that benefit from full
		revision control.
