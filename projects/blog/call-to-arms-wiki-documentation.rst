I'd like to ask gentoo-haskell community for help. We have a nice 
`wiki <http://wiki.gentoo.org>`_ and our project page have moved `there <http://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Haskell>`.
But it seems that we don't have enough documentation quality for end-user
application. As a developers we support proper builds and tests for that
packages but we are not expert users for many of them. So I'd like
to ask community to add some docs and tips for applications you use. 
This basically means installation, advanced configs (examples), interesting usecases, 
links to externall resources (blog posts/documentation) and so on. 
It can help a lot for new gentoo users.

The most interesting projects are:
  * `pandoc <http://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Pandoc>`_
  * `git-annex <http://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Git-annex>`_
  * `gitit <http://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Gitit>`_
  * `yi <http://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/yi>`_
  * `xmonad <http://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Xmonad>`_

Thanks!
